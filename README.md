# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Audio recorder using emUSB-device

This example demonstrates how to implement an audio recorder application by setting up the USB block of PSOC&trade; Edge MCU as a USB Audio Class (UAC) device using the Segger's [emUSB-device](https://github.com/Infineon/emusb-device) middleware.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the title of the code example is displayed on the serial terminal and the kit's user LED (LED1) keeps blinking. The LED keeps blinking until the USB device connection is established between the PC and the kit

4. Connect the kit to the PC using another USB cable plugged into the USB device connector as shown in **Figure 2**

   **Figure 2. USB-device port**

   ![](images/kit-usb-device-port.png)

5. On the Windows computer, verify that a new USB device is enumerated as a microphone and named as "USB Audio Recorder"

   **Figure 3. USB audio device enumeration**

   ![](images/usbd-audio-recorder-enumeration.png)

6. Note that the kit's user LED (LED1) is turned OFF and a "USB Audio Device Connected" status is displayed on the serial terminal as shown in **Figure 4**

   **Figure 4. USB audio device connected**

   ![](images/usbd-audio-recorder-connected.png)

7. Open an audio recorder software tool in the computer. If you do not have one, download the open-source software [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Make sure to select the correct microphone in the audio recorder tool as shown in **Figure 5**

   **Figure 5. USB audio device mic**

   ![](images/usbd-audio-recorder-mic.png)

8. Start a recording session in the audio recorder software. Play a sound or speak over the microphone in the kit. Subsequently, the kit's user LED is turned ON, indicating that the device has started recording

   **Figure 6. Kit PDM microphones**

   ![](images/kit-pdm-mics.png)

9. To exercise the microphone's mute control, open the **Control Panel** from the Windows Start menu, and double-click on the **Sound** menu in it. In the **Sound** window, navigate to the **Recording** tab, and select the detected **Microphone (Audio Control)**

10. Double-click the selected **Microphone (Audio Control)** to open its properties. In the **Microphone Properties** window, toggle the **Mute** ![](images/mute-mic.png) button under the **Levels** tab to mute/unmute the microphone.

    **Figure 7. USB audio device mute**

    ![](images/usbd-audio-recorder-mute-control.png)

11. Stop the recording session and play it to confirm that the audio is recorded correctly. Also, observe that the kit's user LED is turned OFF indicating the end of the recording session

12. Once the USB cable is disconnected from the kit, the kit's user LED (LED1) starts to blink indicating that the USB device is disconnected and waits for the connection
